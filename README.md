# Project as part of the NeuroHackademy 2023

### Project description

**research question**: Can we turn “ordinary” MRI datasets with short scanning times into precision MRI datasets with long scanning times by generating synthetic data using whole-brain models (= computational simulations of brain activity)?

**project outcome**: Python library for turning ordinary MRI datasets into precision MRI datasets

**data**: HCP dataset with long, high-quality fMRI resting state scans + cognitive/ intelligence measures from each subject

**approach**:
1. Proof of concept (answering the research question)
- shorten the empirical HCP fMRI data down to only ~15 min of scanning time per subject
- fit a whole-brain model to the empirical fMRI data of each subject
- elongate the shortened fMRI data by generating synthetic data generated by the fitted whole-brain models
- train a classifier to predict the intelligence scores of subjects based on 3 different neuroimaging datasets
       A) the original, empirical fMRI dataset with long scanning time
       B) the shortened empirical fMRI dataset
       C) the long fMRI dataset that was first cut short and then elongated again using synthetic data
- Hopefully, we can show that classifiers trained on A and C are significantly better than the ones trained on the short neuroimaging data in B. (If that works, that would already be really cool and potentially worth a paper!)
2. Software package
the second part of the project would “simply” be to develop a software package for turning short fMRI datasets into precision fMRI datasets just like we did in part 1 of the project

**more details**:
What type of whole-brain models? Let's try these, because they are relatively simple (few parameters to fit):
- nonlinear oscillator models like in this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304665
- dynamic meanfield models like in this paper (which provides an efficient implementation): https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.11.487903v1
